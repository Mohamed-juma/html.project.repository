atabase languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages:
<br>
Data control language (DCL) – controls access to data;
Data definition language (DDL) – defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them;
Data manipulation language (DML) – performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;
Data query language (DQL) – allows searching for information and computing derived information.
Database languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:
<br>
SQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language.
 It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and is supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs.
OQL is an object model language standard (from the Object Data Management Group).
 It has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL.
XQuery is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as MarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and DB2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon.
SQL/XML combines XQuery with SQL.
A database language may also incorporate features like:
<br>
DBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management
Computations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing
Constraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car)
Application programming interface version of the query language, for programmer convenience
